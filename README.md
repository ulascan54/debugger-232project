# 232 TERM PROJECT GROUP 1

## How to Run This Project

```Makefile
    make
````
- When a user enters "make" into the terminal, the processor.c program is executed. It prompts the user to input values for the variables @var and @traces. Upon pressing 'x', expanded.c is generated. The makefile is then automatically executed to run expanded.c, allowing the user to monitor the desired variables.

```Makefile
    make-check
``` 
- When a user enters "make-check" into the terminal, the processor only executed "expanded.c".
